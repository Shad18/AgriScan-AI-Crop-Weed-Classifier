# 📌 Overview

AgriScan is a deep-learning based agricultural image classification system designed to identify whether a plant belongs to the **Crop** or **Weed** category.

The system leverages a fine-tuned **YOLOv8** model trained on agricultural plant images and provides predictions through a simple and interactive **Streamlit web application**.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning in Smart Agriculture, helping automate crop monitoring and weed identification.

# 📊 Model Performance

The YOLOv8 model was trained on a custom agricultural dataset containing crop and weed images.

| Metric    | Score |
| --------- | ----- |
| Precision | 80.6% |
| Recall    | 77.8% |
| mAP@50    | 85.8% |
| mAP@50-95 | 56.4% |

These results demonstrate strong classification capability while maintaining lightweight inference performance.
